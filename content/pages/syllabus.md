## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for this course.Â 

## Readings and Screenings

In addition to reading assignments, this course requires some viewing of assigned films. A close reading of assigned texts, as well as a fresh viewing of required films by the due date, is indispensable to class discussions and to successfully completing the course.

## Class Participation and Presentations

Informed participation in class discussions is required of each student for successful completion of the course. Each student will be asked to select a topic of interest for ongoing individual research, which will form the basis of the final written project. In addition, students will engage in further research of a selected topic for their oral presentation.

## Written Assignments

For each text, students will write three talking points (1 paragraph each) and/or a 2-page journal response. You should bring a hard copy of your writing to class, as it is the basis of in-class discussions. In addition, these responses should be collected by the student and handed in as a journal at the end of semester.

## Grading

The major components of the course grade are:

- Readings/screenings
- Journal responses and/or talking points
- Midterm essay (4-6 pages)
- Final research paper (10 pages)
- Attendance and active participation
